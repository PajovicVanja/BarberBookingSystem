==============================

**Project Description and Purpose**
-----------------------------------

The **Hairdresser Booking System** is a microservices-based application designed to streamline appointment scheduling for hair salons. The system enables customers to book hairdresser appointments online while allowing hairdressers to manage their availability and appointments efficiently. Additionally, it provides a secure payment processing service for handling transactions.

### **Key Features:**

*   **User Management**: Customers and hairdressers can create and manage their accounts.
    
*   **Appointment Booking**: Customers can book available time slots with their preferred hairdresser.
    
*   **Availability Management**: Hairdressers can define their schedules and update their availability.
    
*   **Payment Processing**: Secure transactions for booking appointments.
    
*   **Scalable Microservices Architecture**: Ensures flexibility, maintainability, and performance.
    

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring business logic remains independent of infrastructure. Each microservice is self-contained and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.
